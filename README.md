# Samurai-Kit

SAMURAI: Samurai are professional warriors, members of the noble class who are trained in the arts of warfare. They are not only trained for their role in society, they are born into a system of allegiance, loyalty, and honor that influences every stage of their lives. A samurai cut loose from this system is no longer a samurai; he is an ordinary fighter, a ronin with no honor and no standing in society.

Advantages:
- May achieve Grand Mastery (five slots) in Katanas, Wakizashis, Morning Stars, Halberds and Longbows.
- May use Kai ability once per day per level.

KAI:  The samurai increases his strength score to 18/00 for 1 round.

- 2nd level: Gains a +1 to damage rolls every 3 levels.
- 5th level: Becomes immune to fear and morale failure.
- 6th level: May cause fear at will.

FEAR: All enemies within visual range of the Samurai are shaken and suffer a -4 penalty to morale.

- 9th level: May use the Great Kai ability once per day.

GREAT KAI: The Samurai increases his strength score to 18/00 for 2 rounds, and may strike blows so forceful that they stun an opponent (Save vs. Death at -4 negates). 

Disadvantages:
- Race restricted to human.
- Alignment restricted to lawful.
- May not wear armour heavier than splint mail.
- May not exceed Specialization (two slots) in any other weapon.
